<div><h2>Pumpkin Mobile 5th Gen</h2><p>The Pumpkin Moible 5th Gen is the latest and greatest phone, with the new PMMS 2.0 built in, and AUAAS support. Also better screen and more efficient battery usage.</p></div>

<div><h2>Pumpkin Mobile SEFLL</h2><p>The Pumpkin Mobile Special Edition for Luke Labs is a toughened up version of the Paper THiN 2, designed for Luke Labs employees. We did this because over at Luke Labs the tests they do can be very harsh on technology, so we signed a contract with them to make a special edition tough phone that can survive all the extreme condition of Luke Labs, and also is seamlessly intergrated with their web & message servers. If you work at Luke Labs, email me proof of working there and we will arrange for you to pick up a P. Mobile SEFLL phone</p></div>
