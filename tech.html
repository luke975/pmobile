<div><h2>Here at Pumpkin Mobile</h2><p>To have our top-of-the-line phones we have to have top-of-the-line technology. Here is going to be a list of all of our technologies. THIS TECHNOLOGY ISN'T ACTUALLY REAL, I JUST MADE IT UP.</p></div>

<div><h2>Pumpkin Mobile Messaging Service</h2><p>PMMS is our new message system for Pumpkin Mobile Paper THiN and newer devices. It utilizes the accounts in our database so if you type in someones L Account email you can message/email them.</p></div>

<div><h2>Pumpkin Insta-Charge</h2><p>Included in our devices since the first phone, you can use a pumpkin to charge your phone! 1 pumpkin will last for 30 years straight of charging, and remember that it only takes 30 seconds to charge!</p></div>

<div><h2>Pumpkin Charge Card</h2><h3>Charge Card Original</h3><p>We took a lot of juice from pumpkins, enhanced it, packed it into a card, and got this! Now if you tap for 5 seconds, your device is at 100%! The card also lasts forever because we added some secret ingredients to make it so the Pumpkin Juice reproduces itself.</p><h3>Charge Card XTREME</h3><p>XTREME takes that, improves it, and makes it take only 2 seconds! It also somehow makes the card last for infitity2 (Infiity X infinity). It also is smaller, so you can fit it in smaller places (Please dont take this out of context..)</p></div>

<div><h2>UEQAS</h2><p>UEQAS (Ultra Enhanced Quality Audio System), is our top of the line audio system present in our phones and tablets. We did this by taking our best speakers, making the components smaller, and putting it in our phones!</p></div>

<div><h2>PUCF</h2><p>Previously C+ZIP, PUCF (Pumpkin Ultra Compressed File) has a really high compression rate, the same rate as if you compressed a .ZIP (Explaining the previous name, Compression + ZIP). So its really good for making things into small file sizes. This technology is open source, so you can put this technology to say, make a new music file that is super small in file size!</p></div>
