<h1>Pumpkin Mobile Technologies</h1>
<p style="font-family: Comic Sans MS"> This page of the website will include all of our technologies used in our devices.

<h1>PMMS (Pumpkin Mobile Messaging Service)</h1>
<p style="font-family: Comic Sans MS"> PMMS is our new message system for Pumpkin Mobile Paper THiN and newer devices. It utilizes the accounts in our database so if you type in someones L Account email you can message/email them.

<h1>Pumpkin Insta-Charge</h1>
<p style="font-family: Comic Sans MS"> Included in our devices since the first phone, you can use a pumpkin to charge your phone! 1 pumpkin will last for 30 years straight of charging, and remember that it only takes 30 seconds to charge!

<h1>Pumpkin Charge Card and Charge Card XTREME</h1>
<p style="font-family: Comic Sans MS"> We took a lot of juice from pumpkins, enhanced it, packed it into a card, and got this! Now if you tap for 5 seconds, your device is at 100%! The card also lasts forever because we added some secret ingredients to make it so the Pumpkin Juice reproduces itself. XTREME takes that, improves it, and makes it take only 2 seconds!

<h1>UEQAS</h1>
<p style="font-family: Comic Sans MS"> UEQAS (Ultra Enhanced Quality Audio System), is our top of the line audio system present in our phones and tablets. We did this by taking our best speakers, making the components smaller, and putting it in our phones!

<h1>C+ZIP</h1>
<p style="font-family: Comic Sans MS"> Compression + .ZIP, AKA .CPZIP, is our compression system used in our devices to make up for the low amount of storage (Only 32 GB). Even though thats plenty, we want to make sure there is still enough space available for future updates. Thats why C+ZIP was made. It compresses .zip files, which makes the .CPZIP file.
